          <b>Simple example</b>

        </Col>
        <Col span={22} offset={2}>
          <Code code={JavaTutorialChapter4Data.one} language="java" />

        <Col span={22} offset={2}>
          <Code code={JavaTutorialChapter4Data.two} language="sql" />

        <Col span={23} offset={1}>
          <p>The key points to note from this example are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The source filename "HelloWorld.java" must match the class name in the source file ... which is
              HelloWorld. If they don't match, you will get a compilation error
            </li>
            <li>
              The bytecode filename "HelloWorld.class" corresponds to the classname. If you were to rename the
              "HelloWorld.class", you would get an error when your tried to run it.
            </li>
            <li>When running a Java application using java, you supply the classname NOT the bytecode filename.</li>
          </ol>
          <b>Example with packages</b>
          <p>
            Most practical Java code uses packages to organize the namespace for classes and reduce the risk of
            accidental class name collision.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we wanted to declare the HelloWorld class in a package call com.example, the "HelloWorld.java" would
            contain the following Java source:
          </p>
        </Col>
        <Col span={22} offset={2}>
          <Code code={JavaTutorialChapter4Data.four} language="java" />
        </Col>

        <Col span={23} offset={1}>
          <p>
            This source code file needs to stored in a directory tree whose structure corresponds to the package naming
          </p>
        </Col>
        <Col span={22} offset={2}>
          <Code code={JavaTutorialChapter4Data.five} language="sql" />
        </Col>

        <Col span={23} offset={1}>
          <p>We can compile the above file using this command:</p>
        </Col>
        <Col span={22} offset={2}>
          <Code code={JavaTutorialChapter4Data.six} language="sql" />
        </Col>

        <Col span={23} offset={1}>
          <p>
            This produces a file called "com/example/HelloWorld.class"; i.e. after compilation, the file structure
            should look like this:
          </p>
        </Col>
        <Col span={22} offset={2}>
          <Code code={JavaTutorialChapter4Data.seven} language="sql" />
        </Col>

        <Col span={23} offset={1}>
          <p>We can then run the application as follows:</p>
        </Col>
        <Col span={22} offset={2}>
          <Code code={JavaTutorialChapter4Data.eight} language="sql" />
        </Col>

        <Col span={23} offset={1}>
          <p>Additional points to note from this example are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The directory structure must match the package name structure.</li>
            <li>
              When you run the class, the full class name must be supplied; i.e. "com.example.HelloWorld" not
              "HelloWorld"
            </li>
            <li>
              You don't have to compile and run Java code out of the current directory. We are just doing it here for
              illustration
            </li>
          </ol>
          <b>Compiling multiple files at once with 'javac'.</b>
          <p>
            If your application consists of multiple source code files (and most do!) you can compile them one at a
            time. Alternatively, you can compile multiple files at the same time by listing the pathnames:
          </p>
        </Col>
        <Col span={22} offset={2}>
          <Code code={JavaTutorialChapter4Data.nine} language="sql" />
        </Col>

        <Col span={23} offset={1}>
          <p>or using your command shell's filename wildcard functionality ....</p>
        </Col>
        <Col span={22} offset={2}>
          <Code code={JavaTutorialChapter4Data.ten} language="sql" />
        </Col>

        <Col span={23} offset={1}>
          <p>
            This will compile all Java source files in the current directory, in the "com/example" directory, and
            recursively in child directories respectively. A third alternative is to supply a list of source filenames
            (and compiler options) as a file. For example:
          </p>
        </Col>
        <Col span={22} offset={2}>
          <Code code={JavaTutorialChapter4Data.elevent} language="sql" />
        </Col>

        <Col span={23} offset={1}>
          <p>where the sourcefiles file contains:</p>
        </Col>
        <Col span={22} offset={2}>
          <Code code={JavaTutorialChapter4Data.twelve} language="sql" />
        </Col>

        <Col span={23} offset={1}>
          <p>
            Note: compiling code like this is appropriate for small one-person projects, and for once-off programs.
            Beyond that, it is advisable to select and use a Java build tool. Alternatively, most programmers use a Java
            IDE (e.g. NetBeans, eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) which offers an embedded compiler and incremental building of
            "projects".
          </p>
          <b>Commonly used 'javac' options</b>
          <p>Here are a few options for the javac command that are likely to be useful to you</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The -d option sets a destination directory for writing the ".class" files.</li>
            <li>The -sourcepath option sets a source code search path.</li>
            <li>
              The -cp or -classpath option sets the search path for finding external and previously compiled classes.
              For more information on the classpath and how to specify it, refer to the The Classpath Topic.
            </li>
            <li>The -version option prints the compiler's version information.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A more complete list of compiler options will be described in a separate example.</p>

        <Col span={23} offset={1}>
          <p>
            The Java programming language (and its runtime) has undergone numerous changes since its release since its
            initial public release. These changes include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Changes in the Java programming language syntax and semantics</li>
            <li>Changes in the APIs provided by the Java standard class libraries.</li>
            <li>Changes in the Java (bytecode) instruction set and classfile format.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With very few exceptions (for example the enum keyword, changes to some "internal" classes, etc), these
            changes are backwards compatible.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A Java program that was compiled using an older version of the Java toolchain will run on a newer version
              Java platform without recompilation.
            </li>
            <li>
              A Java program that was written in an older version of Java will compile successfully with a new Java

          <b>Compiling old Java with a newer compiler</b>
          <p>
            If you need to (re-)compile older Java code on a newer Java platform to run on the newer platform, you
            generally don't need to give any special compilation flags. In a few cases (e.g. if you had used enum as an
            identifier) you could use the -source option to disable the new syntax. For example, given the following
            class:

          <b>Compiling for an older execution platform</b>
          <p>
            If you need to compile Java to run on an older Java platforms, the simplest approach is to install a JDK for
            the oldest version you need to support, and use that JDK's compiler in your builds.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also compile with a newer Java compiler, but there are complicated. First of all, there some
            important preconditions that must be satisfied:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The code you are compiling must not use Java language constructs that were not available in the version of
              Java that you are targeting.
            </li>
            <li>
              The code must not depend on standard Java classes, fields, methods and so on that were not available in
              the older platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Third party libraries that the code depends must also be built for the older platform and available at
              compiletime and run-time.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Given the preconditions are met, you can recompile code for an older platform using the -target option. For
            example
          </p>
        </Col>
        <Col span={22} offset={2}>
          <Code code={JavaTutorialChapter4Data.fifteen} language="sql" />
        </Col>

        <Col span={23} offset={1}>
          <p>
            will compile the above class to produce bytecodes that are compatible with Java 1.4 or later JVM. (In fact,
            the - source option implies a compatible -target, so javac -source 1.4 ... would have the same effect. The
            relationship between -source and -target is described in the Oracle documentation.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Having said that, if you simply use -target or -source, you will still be compiling against the standard
            class libraries provided by the compiler's JDK. If you are not careful, you can end up with classes with the
            correct bytecode version, but with dependencies on APIs that are not available. The solution is to use the
            -bootclasspath option. For example:
          </p>

        <Col span={23} offset={1}>
          <p>
            will compile against an alternative set of runtime libraries. If the class being compiled has (accidental)
            dependencies on newer libraries, this will give you compilation errors.
